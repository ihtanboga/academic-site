        My research lies at the intersection of **interventional cardiology**, **biostatistics**, and **digital health**. I lead multicenter randomized clinical trials, observational studies, and registry-based real-world evidence projects. I am particularly interested in applying artificial intelligence and machine learning methods to cardiovascular outcome research.

        I am always open to collaborations — feel free to reach out via email.
